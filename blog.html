                    <p>In 2004 my brother—stage name “the Latino Saint,” or “Saint” for short— released a crunk rap album  entitled, Half Breed. As far back as I can remember, his music has pretty much always been about partying and taking pride in Mexican and Latino identities; this album is no exception. Half Breed takes its name from the mixed Mexican and white backgrounds from which we both come. As with most crunk music, much of the content is centered around alcohol, dancing and celebrating life with friends and family. Yet, in spite of the negative connotation of the term “half breed” itself, Saint delivers these club songs from an unapologetically Mexican perspective, reclaiming both the term and the concept of “half breed” and using it to assert his own position as a Mexican MC from the Midwest. </p>
                        <p align="right">This album had an enormous impact on the formation of my own Mexican identity as a child, as did the many concerts I watched Saint perform at clubs across lower Michigan. I’d also often take my friends along with me to the concerts after sharing with them my brother’s CDs. While I didn’t think of it this way at the time, handing this music to my (mostly white and black) friends was also a way for me to affirm my own Mexicaness. We certainly weren’t learning about Mexican culture in school, so this was one of the few opportunities I had to tangibly hand something to my friends and say, “check this out” (literally) or “this is who I am” (figuratively). The concept of “half breed” resonated with me because of the bi-racial dynamics of my household, and because of positive manner in which it was presented to me through my brother’s music, but at times it also internalized for me a particular feeling of racial inadequacy. </p>
                            <p>This feeling can be best explained by considering it within the context of Jack Forbes’ analysis of cultural mixing. In his book, Aztecas Del Norte: The Chicanos of Aztlan, Forbes argues that terms such as “half breed” and “mestizo” are concepts that were created and proliferated by Spanish colonizers as part of a racist system used to control Native populations (188-189). In using this divide and conquer tactic, the Spanish turned Natives against one another by creating a racial hierarchy that quantifies people’s race and ethinicity, therein incentivizing competition over the privileges granted to those who assimilate with white, Western, or specifically Spanish cultural and social ways of being. From this perspective, to accept and utilize the concept of mestizaje—at least as it has been handed down by Spanish colonizers—is to play into the racial hierarchy and to enact violence against Native and Indigenous people.  </p>
